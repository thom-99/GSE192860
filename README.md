### Targeting Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma: RNA-Seq Insights on Trifluoperazine's Potential

![Progetto senza titolo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/487ec831-693b-40f3-af76-0c9567cf7e64)


this repository aims to analyze the potential therapeutic effects of [trifluoperazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trifluoperazine), a common antipsychotic drug used mainly to treat schizophrenia, on nasopharingeal carcinoma. 

the [data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE192860) can be accessed through GEO

the code aims to be reproducible. I've included links to online resources which I deem useful to clarifying difficult concepts or functions. Nonetheless, were something not to be clear please feel free to ask.
