![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cddee00-20e5-4290-b27b-a0f4f78d084c)

this repository aims to analyze the potential therapeutic effects of [trifluoperazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trifluoperazine), a common antipsychotic drug used mainly to treat schizophrenia, on nasopharingeal carcinoma. 

the [data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE192860) can be accessed through GEO

the code aims to be reproducible. I've included links to online resources which I deem useful to clarifying difficult concepts or functions. Nonetheless, were something not to be clear please feel free to ask.
